You need to serialize a data structure containing multiple types of data (e.g., integers, strings, and floats) into
 a byte stream for sending over the network. How would you implement this serialization and deserialization in C++?

Follow-up:
Write a C++ program to serialize and deserialize a simple struct that contains an integer, a string, and a float. 
Use binary serialization for efficiency.

serialization is the process of converting an object into a sequence of bytes so that it can be stored in memory or transmitted 
across
 a network

Serialization is about taking a snapshot of your memory and restoring it later on. Each object is represented as a separate entity
 (though they might be composed)
Messaging is about sending information from one point to another. The message usually has its own grammar and may not reflect
 the organization of your Business Model.
Too often I've seen people using Serialization where Messaging should have been used. It does not mean that Serialization is useless,
 but it does mean that you should think ahead of times. It's quite difficult to alter the BOM once you have decided to serialize it,
  especially if you decide to relocate some part of information (move it from one object to another)... 
  because how then are you going to decode the "old" serialized version ?
