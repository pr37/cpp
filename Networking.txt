IP Routing involves determining the path that data packets take from the source to the
 destination through a network. This is done using routing tables, which store information 
 about various routes.

Static Routing: In static routing, routes are manually configured and do not change unless
 manually updated. The router will always follow the same predefined route, making it simple
  but less flexible and scalable for dynamic network conditions.

Example: A static route might be configured like this:

ip route 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.0.1
This means traffic destined for the 192.168.1.0 network is always forwarded through the gateway
 at 192.168.0.1.

Dynamic Routing: Dynamic routing allows routers to automatically learn and adjust routes
 based on network conditions (e.g., changes in topology, link failure). This is typically
  done using routing protocols like OSPF (Open Shortest Path First), 
  RIP (Routing Information Protocol), or BGP (Border Gateway Protocol).
   Routers communicate with each other to share information and update their routing tables
    dynamically.

ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) is used to map an IP address to a MAC address in a local area network (LAN).
