1. Kernel in Linux & Hardware Interaction
The kernel is the core part of Linux that manages system resources (memory, CPU, I/O). It interacts with hardware through device drivers, controlling devices and abstracting hardware details from user applications.

2. Writing a Linux Driver
A Linux driver allows the kernel to communicate with hardware. Key components include:

Initialization function to set up the device.
File operations to handle I/O operations.
Interrupt handling for hardware events.
Cleanup function for resource deallocation.
3. System Calls in Linux
System calls allow user applications to request services from the kernel (e.g., file operations). They switch the CPU from user mode to kernel mode to execute privileged operations.

4. User Space vs Kernel Space & Communication
User space runs applications and doesn't have direct access to hardware.
Kernel space handles system operations with full hardware access. Communication happens via system calls, IOCTL, shared memory, and signals.
5. Multi-threading & Synchronization
Linux supports multi-threading using pthreads. Synchronization is done using mutexes, semaphores, and condition variables to prevent race conditions.

6. Process vs Thread
Process: Independent with its own memory space, slower context switching.
Thread: Lightweight, shares memory with other threads in the same process, faster context switching.
