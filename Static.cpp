No, static fields (or static member variables) in a class are not initialized in the class constructor. Instead, they are
 initialized outside the constructor, typically in the global scope or in a separate definition.

Key Points About Static Members:
Static Member Variables:

A static member variable is shared by all instances of a class. It does not belong to any specific instance but instead 
exists at 
the class level.
Static members are typically initialized outside of the constructor, even though they are declared inside the class definition.
Constructor's Role:

The constructor is used to initialize instance variables (non-static members) for a specific object. It is not involved
 in the 
initialization of static members.
Static members must be initialized separately because they are shared across all instances of the class, not tied to a 
particular 
instance.
Example:
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class MyClass {
public:
    MyClass() {
        // This initializes instance member variables, not static members.
        cout << "Constructor called" << endl;
    }

    static int staticVar; // Static member variable declaration
    int instanceVar; // Instance member variable
};

// Static member variable definition and initialization (outside the constructor)
int MyClass::staticVar = 10; 

int main() {
    MyClass obj1; // Constructor is called for obj1

    // Accessing static variable without creating an instance
    cout << "Static variable: " << MyClass::staticVar << endl;

    // Creating another object to show that staticVar is shared among instances
    MyClass obj2;
    obj2.staticVar = 20;

    cout << "Static variable after modification: " << MyClass::staticVar << endl;

    return 0;
}
Output:
Constructor called
Static variable: 10
Constructor called
Static variable after modification: 20
Explanation:
The static member variable staticVar is defined and initialized outside the constructor (in the global scope) 
using int MyClass::staticVar = 10;.
The constructor MyClass() is only responsible for initializing instance variables (like instanceVar), not static variables.
When a new object obj2 is created, the static variable staticVar is shared between all instances of MyClass. Changes to staticVar
 affect all instances.
Conclusion:
Static fields are not initialized inside the constructor. They are initialized once outside the constructor, usually in the source
 file (outside of the class definition), and their value is shared across all instances of the class.
